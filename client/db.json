I typed one command, and boom 💥—it built an entire feature while I made coffee.\n\nWho needs sleep-deprived late-night coding sessions when you’ve got a tool that practically writes your app for you? If this keeps up, I’ll be out of a job… or maybe promoted to 'Chief Scaffolding Officer' 🤓. Either way, 10/10 would scaffold again!",

What’s next? A template for writing comments?\n\nHonestly, this is just overengineering for the sake of it. Back in my day, we copy-pasted everything like true warriors. But hey, if you enjoy pretending you’re a code wizard while a script does the real work, go for it. 🙃",
