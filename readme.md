## üå≥ Git Branching & Workflow
üîπ Creating branch from JIRA
1. Go to the JIRA issue you're working on
2. Click on "Create branch" in Jira (on the issue page)
3. Go to the terminal and run: `git fetch`
4. Switch to the newly created branch: `git checkout TJN-21-Create-README`

This automatically links your branch, commits and PRs to the JIRA issue.

üîπ Creating a branch manually
If creating manually, always branch from main:
````
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b <issue-key>-<short-description>
````

Example: `git checkout -b TJN-21-Create-README`

Include the Jira issue key (e.g., TJN-21) to automatically link your branch to the issue. This helps track progress, commits, and PRs directly in Jira.


## üîÑ Committing Changes (Conventional Commits)

### Use Conventional Commit messages for consistency:

Format: ```git commit -m "<type>(optional scope): <description>"```

Examples:
```
git commit -m "feat(guest): add temporary guest parking feature"
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update local setup instructions"
```

### Commit Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Style-related changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- chore: Maintenance tasks
- test: Adding/improving tests

## üîÄ Pushing & Merging Branches
1. Rebase Your Branch (Before Pushing)

Before pushing your changes, ensure your branch is up-to-date with main:
```

git pull origin main

git checkout <your-branch-name>
git rebase main
```
Resolve any conflicts if they arise.

Continue rebasing after resolving conflicts:
```
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

2. Push Your Branch

`git push origin <your-branch-name>`


3. Open a Pull Request (PR):

- Link the related JIRA issue (e.g., APT-101).

4. Request a Review:
- Assign the PR to a reviewer (1 leads and 1 other team member).
- Address comments promptly.
