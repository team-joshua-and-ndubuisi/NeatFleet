# NeatFleet


We‚Äôre solving the problem of market friction between service providers (technicians) and customers. It‚Äôs often hard for people to find trustworthy, available professionals, and for technicians to find steady work. Our app makes that connection seamless by offering booking, service management, and rating tools that build trust and convenience on both sides.

- Secure credit card payment during booking.
- Automatic invoice generation for each booking.
- Rate the service after completion.
- View upcoming and historical bookings.
- Receive real-time updates on a booking‚Äôs service status.

## üå≥ Git Branching & Workflow
üîπ Creating branch from JIRA
1. Go to the JIRA issue you're working on
2. Click on "Create branch" in Jira (on the issue page)
3. Go to the terminal and run: `git fetch`
4. Switch to the newly created branch: `git checkout TJN-21-Create-README`

This automatically links your branch, commits and PRs to the JIRA issue.

üîπ Creating a branch manually
If creating manually, always branch from main:
````
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b <issue-key>-<short-description>
````

Example: `git checkout -b TJN-21-Create-README`

Include the Jira issue key (e.g., TJN-21) to automatically link your branch to the issue. This helps track progress, commits, and PRs directly in Jira.


## üîÑ Committing Changes (Conventional Commits)

### Use Conventional Commit messages for consistency:

Format: ```git commit -m "<type>(optional scope): <description>"```

Examples:
```
git commit -m "feat(guest): add temporary guest parking feature"
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update local setup instructions"
```

### Commit Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Style-related changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- chore: Maintenance tasks
- test: Adding/improving tests

## üîÄ Pushing & Merging Branches
1. Rebase Your Branch (Before Pushing)

Before pushing your changes, ensure your branch is up-to-date with main:
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout <your-branch-name>
git rebase main
```
Resolve any conflicts if they arise.

Continue rebasing after resolving conflicts:
```
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

2. Push Your Branch

`git push origin <your-branch-name>`


3. Open a Pull Request (PR):
- Navigate to GitHub repo.
- Click Compare & pull request.
- Provide a descriptive title and description.
- Link the related JIRA issue (e.g., APT-101).

4. Request a Review:
- Assign the PR to a reviewer (1 leads and 1 other team member).
- Address comments promptly.
- How to add meaningful comments during code review: https://conventionalcomments.org/

5. Merge After Approval:
- Merge using Squash and Merge option.
- Delete your branch after merging.


## üí¨ Comments & Documentation
Inline Comments: Use clear comments to explain complex logic.

PR Descriptions: Always include what was done, why, and how to test. Screenshot of the visual change is always reccommended.

Example PR Description:
